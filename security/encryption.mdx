## Data Encryption

- **Storage Encryption**: AES-256 with cloud-managed encryption keys for all stored data
- **Communication Encryption**: TLS 1.3 enforced for all traffic between services and external endpoints
- **Key Management**: Cloud KMS integration with strict access controls and automatic key rotation
- **Reference**: Industry-standard encryption policies aligned with NIST guidelines

## Network Security

- **Protocol**: HTTPS enforced across all endpoints — no unencrypted communication permitted
- **SSL Configuration**: Comprehensive SSL certificate deployment with automatic renewal
- **Traffic Protection**: End-to-end encrypted communications between all system components
- **Voice Data**: Real-time voice streams encrypted in transit via SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)

## Infrastructure Security

- **Cloud Provider**: Healthcare-grade cloud infrastructure with executed BAA
- **Architecture**: Multi-service microservices architecture with service mesh encryption (mutual TLS)
- **Access Control**: Restricted infrastructure modification access with MFA and audit logging
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts and automated remediation for security events

## Conversation Data Encryption

- **Voice recordings**: Encrypted at rest using AES-256 immediately upon capture
- **Transcripts**: Encrypted in storage and during processing pipeline
- **Clinical extractions**: Structured data encrypted at field level for sensitive PHI elements
- **EHR data cache**: Encrypted in-memory cache with automatic expiration and secure clearing
