description: "HANA is built for healthcare. Here's how we protect patient data, meet regulatory requirements, and maintain clinical safety."

## Security Principles

HANA is healthcare infrastructure. Security isn't a feature — it's the foundation everything is built on. Three principles guide every architectural decision:

1. **Data stays where it needs to stay.** Regional deployment means patient data never leaves the jurisdiction where it was collected.
2. **No one sees what they shouldn't.** Organization-level isolation, encryption at rest and in transit, and strict access controls.
3. **AI actions are auditable.** Every patient interaction, reasoning decision, and clinical note is logged and traceable.

## Regulatory Compliance

### HIPAA (United States)

| Requirement | How HANA Meets It |
|------------|-------------------|
| PHI Encryption | AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit |
| Access Controls | Role-based access, organization-scoped API keys |
| Audit Trails | Complete interaction logs with timestamps |
| BAA | Business Associate Agreement executed with all customers |
| Minimum Necessary | Reasoning engine only accesses data relevant to the engagement protocol |
| SMS Compliance | HIPAA-compliant SMS gateway for US deployments |

### GDPR (European Union)

| Requirement | How HANA Meets It |
|------------|-------------------|
| Data Residency | EU data processed on EU-hosted servers only |
| Lawful Basis | Legitimate interest for care delivery; explicit consent for research |
| Right to Erasure | Patient data deletion via API or dashboard |
| Data Minimization | Only data required for the active protocol is accessed |
| DPA | Data Processing Agreement executed with all EU customers |
| No Cross-Border Transfer | Data does not leave the EU region |

### Country-Specific

HANA adapts to local regulatory requirements across deployment regions:

| Region | Framework | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| United States | HIPAA | ✅ Compliant |
| European Union | GDPR | ✅ Compliant |
| United Kingdom | UK GDPR + DPA 2018 | ✅ Compliant |
| Ireland (HSE) | HSE Data Protection Standards | ✅ Active deployment |
| Italy | GDPR + Garante guidelines | ✅ Active deployment |
| Middle East | Sovereign cloud requirements | 🔄 In progress |

## Data Architecture

### Encryption

All patient data is encrypted at every stage:

| Stage | Encryption Standard |
|-------|-------------------|
| In transit | TLS 1.3 (minimum TLS 1.2) |
| At rest | AES-256 |
| Backups | AES-256 with separate key management |
| API keys | Hashed with bcrypt, never stored in plaintext |

### Data Isolation

Each organization's data is fully isolated:

```
Organization A                    Organization B
├── Patients (A only)             ├── Patients (B only)
├── Engagements (A only)          ├── Engagements (B only)
├── Clinical Notes (A only)       ├── Clinical Notes (B only)
├── Protocols (A only)            ├── Protocols (B only)
└── Audit Logs (A only)           └── Audit Logs (B only)
```

Cross-organization data access is architecturally impossible — not just restricted by policy.

### Data Residency

HANA runs on region-locked infrastructure. When you choose a deployment region, all data processing stays within that region:

| Region | Infrastructure | Data Stays In |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `us` | US-based servers | United States |
| `eu` | EU-based servers | European Union |
| `uk` | UK-based servers | United Kingdom |
| `on-premise` | Your servers | Your facility |

```javascript
const hana = new HanaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.HANA_API_KEY,
  region: 'eu' // All data stays in EU
});
```

## AI-Specific Security

### No Third-Party Model Dependencies

HANA runs its own models on its own servers. Patient data is **never** sent to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or any third-party AI provider.

| Component | What Runs It |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reasoning Engine | HANA proprietary model (OSS-based, self-hosted) |
| Voice Agent | Llama 3.1 (self-hosted) |
| Voice Synthesis | Self-hosted TTS |
| Transcription | Self-hosted ASR |

This is a core architectural decision — not a configuration option. It means:
- No patient data leaves HANA's infrastructure
- No dependency on third-party AI provider terms of service
- Full control over model behavior and updates
- Compliance with data residency requirements

### Conversation Guardrails

Every patient interaction is monitored in real-time by safety classifiers:

| Guardrail | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Risk detection | NLP classifiers monitor for self-harm, suicidality, acute distress |
| Topic boundaries | Agent stays within defined clinical protocol |
| Escalation triggers | Automatic handoff to humans when safety thresholds are crossed |
| Hallucination prevention | Pre-computed question sets prevent the agent from improvising clinical advice |
| Audit trail | Every interaction turn is logged with reasoning context |

### Human-in-the-Loop Safety

HANA does not operate autonomously. The safety architecture ensures human oversight:

1. **Protocol definition** — Clinicians define what the AI should and shouldn't discuss
2. **Real-time monitoring** — Safety classifiers run during every conversation
3. **Automatic escalation** — Risk signals immediately pause AI and route to humans
4. **Post-interaction review** — Clinical notes are available for clinician review before action
5. **Override capability** — Care teams can pause, modify, or cancel any engagement at any time

<Note>
HANA has managed over 1 million patient interactions with **zero critical adverse events**. Safety is validated across psychiatric, palliative, chronic care, and surgical populations.
</Note>

## Access Controls

### API Key Scoping

API keys are scoped by organization and permission level:

| Scope | Permissions |
|-------|-----------|
| `full_access` | Create/read/update/delete all resources |
| `engagements_only` | Create/read engagements, receive webhooks |
| `read_only` | Read-only access to all resources |

### Dashboard Access

The HANA clinical dashboard supports role-based access:

| Role | Can Do |
|------|--------|
| Admin | Full configuration, user management, protocol editing |
| Clinician | View patient engagements, review notes, manage escalations |
| Viewer | Read-only access to dashboards and reports |

---

## Audit & Logging

Every action in HANA is logged:

| Event Type | What's Logged |
|-----------|-------------|
| Patient interaction | Full conversation transcript, reasoning decisions, outcome |
| API access | Endpoint, method, requester, timestamp, response code |
| Configuration change | What changed, who changed it, when |
| Escalation | Trigger reason, actions taken, resolution |
| Data access | Which patient data was accessed, by what process, when |

Audit logs are retained for a minimum of 7 years (configurable per organization).

```bash
# Query audit logs via API
GET /v1/audit-logs?resource_type=engagement&from=2026-01-01&to=2026-02-07
```

---

## Incident Response

HANA maintains a documented incident response plan:

| Severity | Response Time | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Critical (P1) | 15 minutes | Patient safety event, data breach |
| High (P2) | 1 hour | Service outage, integration failure |
| Medium (P3) | 4 hours | Degraded performance, non-critical bug |
| Low (P4) | 24 hours | Minor UI issue, documentation error |

Customers are notified immediately for P1/P2 incidents via their configured contact channels.

---

## On-Premise Deployment

For organizations requiring maximum control, HANA supports on-premise installation:

- HANA's models and infrastructure run entirely on your servers
- No data leaves your network
- Licensed on a per-deployment basis
- Currently being piloted in Italy (hospital setting) and Middle East (sovereign cloud)

See [Deployment Options](/infrastructure/deployment) for technical details.
