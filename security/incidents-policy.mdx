## Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

### Backup Strategy

- **Automated Backups**: Daily automated backups with point-in-time recovery for all critical data
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Geographic distribution for disaster recovery — conversation data replicated across availability zones
- **Backup Testing**: Regular restore testing and validation on quarterly schedule
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention based on compliance requirements and healthcare organization policies

### High Availability

- **Multi-Zone Deployment**: Services deployed across multiple availability zones for fault tolerance
- **Auto-Scaling**: Horizontal and vertical scaling based on concurrent call volume and time-of-day patterns
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure detection and isolation — degraded service doesn't cascade to other components
- **Health Checks**: Continuous health monitoring with automatic remediation and service restart

### Incident Response

- **Runbooks**: Documented procedures for common incidents (EHR connectivity loss, voice service degradation, model performance issues)
- **On-Call Rotation**: 24/7 coverage with defined escalation procedures
- **Post-Incident Reviews**: Blameless postmortems with documented action items and follow-through tracking
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Target MTTR of less than 30 minutes for critical issues affecting live patient conversations

### Risk & Incident Management

- **Incident response procedures**: Severity classification, communication templates, and resolution workflows
- **Risk assessment frameworks**: Regular risk assessments covering infrastructure, data, and AI-specific risks
- **Vendor risk management**: Third-party vendor security assessments and ongoing monitoring

### Operational Monitoring

- **Status**: Live monitoring with 24/7 coverage
- **Coverage**: Infrastructure, application, and conversation quality monitoring
- **Response**: Automated remediation systems for known failure patterns
- **Escalation**: Defined incident response procedures with clear ownership
