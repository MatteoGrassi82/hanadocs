## Regional Deployment

HANA's infrastructure is deployed regionally. When you select a region, all data processing — AI reasoning, patient interactions, clinical notes, audit logs — stays within that region.

This is an architectural guarantee, not a policy promise. The systems are physically separate.

### Available Regions

| Region Code | Location | Compliance | Status |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| `us-east` | United States (East) | HIPAA | ✅ Production |
| `eu-west` | European Union (Ireland) | GDPR | ✅ Production |
| `eu-south` | European Union (Italy) | GDPR + Garante | ✅ Production |
| `uk` | United Kingdom | UK GDPR | ✅ Production |
| `on-premise` | Your infrastructure | Your policies | 🔄 Pilot |
| `me` | Middle East (Sovereign Cloud) | Regional sovereign | 🔄 Pilot |

### Region Selection

Region is configured at the organization level and cannot be changed after deployment:

```javascript
const hana = new HanaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.HANA_API_KEY,
  region: 'eu-west' // Data stays in EU-West (Ireland)
});
```

<Warning>
Region cannot be changed after initial deployment without a data migration process. Choose carefully during onboarding.
</Warning>

## What Stays in Region

Everything:

| Data Type | In-Region |
|-----------|-----------|
| Patient demographics | ✅ |
| Clinical data (diagnoses, medications) | ✅ |
| Conversation transcripts | ✅ |
| Voice recordings (where enabled) | ✅ |
| Clinical notes (generated) | ✅ |
| AI model inference | ✅ |
| Reasoning engine computations | ✅ |
| Audit logs | ✅ |
| API request logs | ✅ |
| Encryption keys | ✅ |

### What Does NOT Cross Regions

- Patient data never crosses regional boundaries
- AI model inference runs on regional compute
- No data is sent to third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Backup replication stays within the same geographic region

## Sovereign & On-Premise Deployment

For organizations requiring maximum data control, HANA supports deployment on your own infrastructure.

### On-Premise Architecture

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Requirements

| Component | Minimum Spec |
|-----------|-------------|
| Compute | 8 vCPUs, 32GB RAM (reasoning engine) |
| GPU | NVIDIA A10G or equivalent (voice model inference) |
| Storage | 500GB SSD |
| Network | Internal network access to EHR systems |
| OS | Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ or RHEL 8+) |

### Licensing

On-premise deployments are licensed per-installation:
- Annual license fee
- Includes updates and model improvements
- Remote support and monitoring (optional, requires secure tunnel)

### Current Pilots

| Organization | Region | Use Case |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Hospital system (Italy) | EU | HIV patient engagement |
| Sovereign cloud (Middle East) | ME | National health engagement |

## Data Retention

Default retention periods:

| Data Type | Retention |
|-----------|----------|
| Conversation transcripts | 7 years |
| Clinical notes | 7 years |
| Audit logs | 7 years |
| Voice recordings | 90 days (configurable) |
| Patient memory/preferences | Until patient deletion or org offboarding |

Retention periods are configurable per organization. Data deletion is available via API or dashboard.

### Right to Erasure (GDPR)

For GDPR regions, patient data can be fully deleted:

```bash
DELETE /v1/patients/{patient_id}?erase=true
```

This removes all patient data including:
- Demographics and clinical data
- Engagement history and transcripts
- Clinical notes
- Memory and preference data
- Audit logs (anonymized, not deleted, per regulatory requirement)
