## Designed for Fast Adoption

Healthcare organizations have limited patience for long implementation cycles. Every week of delayed deployment is a week of missed patient engagement, unrealized revenue, and continued manual workflow burden.

HANA's implementation framework is built around a 30-day deployment cycle with five structured phases. No hardware to install, no IT infrastructure changes, and minimal staff training required.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Days 1-5)

**Objective:** Understand the organization's workflows, identify highest-impact use cases, and define success criteria.

**Activities:**
- Clinical workflow mapping: Document current patient engagement processes, pain points, and bottlenecks
- EHR system assessment: Identify EHR platform, available APIs, and integration requirements
- Use case prioritization: Select initial deployment scope (typically 1-2 protocols)
- Success metrics definition: Agree on KPIs for the pilot (completion rates, patient satisfaction, staff time savings)
- Implementation roadmap: Detailed timeline with milestones and responsible parties

**Deliverables:**
- Workflow analysis document
- Integration requirements specification
- Prioritized use case list with expected impact
- Pilot success criteria and measurement plan

**Organization effort required:** 8-12 hours of stakeholder time (clinical lead, IT lead, operations lead)

### Phase 2: Configuration & Integration (Days 6-15)

**Objective:** Connect HANA to the organization's systems and configure clinical protocols.

**Activities:**
- EHR API connection: Establish secure data exchange between HANA and the organization's EHR
- Data mapping: Map patient fields, appointment data, and clinical data between systems
- Protocol configuration: Customize HANA's clinical protocols to match the organization's specific workflows, terminology, and requirements
- Voice and language setup: Configure voice persona, language preferences, and communication style
- Security verification: Validate encryption, access controls, and compliance requirements

**Pre-Built Integrations:**

| EHR System | Integration Type | Setup Time |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Epic | FHIR R4 API | 3-5 days |
| Cerner/Oracle Health | FHIR R4 API | 3-5 days |
| Athenahealth | REST API | 2-4 days |
| AllScripts | API + HL7 | 4-6 days |
| eClinicalWorks | API | 3-5 days |
| DrChrono | REST API | 2-3 days |
| Custom/Other | HL7 FHIR or custom | 5-10 days |

**Organization effort required:** 10-15 hours of IT and clinical team time

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Days 16-25)

**Objective:** Verify clinical accuracy, technical reliability, and workflow integration before go-live.

**Testing Layers:**

**Functional testing:**
- End-to-end conversation flow for each configured protocol
- EHR data retrieval and write-back accuracy
- Branch logic validation for all protocol paths
- Escalation trigger testing

**Clinical validation:**
- Clinical team reviews sample conversations for accuracy and appropriateness
- Edge case testing with challenging patient scenarios
- Medication and condition entity accuracy verification
- Safety protocol testing (distress detection, escalation handling)

**Integration testing:**
- Data flow between HANA and EHR confirmed
- Appointment scheduling integration verified
- Notification and alert delivery tested
- Reporting and analytics pipeline validated

**User acceptance testing:**
- Staff members interact with the system as simulated patients
- Clinical leads review conversation transcripts
- Operations team validates workflow integration
- Patient experience team assesses communication quality

**Organization effort required:** 15-20 hours across clinical, IT, and operations teams

### Phase 4: Training & Deployment (Days 26-30)

**Objective:** Train staff, deploy to production, and begin live patient conversations.

**Staff training:**
- Dashboard walkthrough: How to view conversation outcomes, patient responses, and quality metrics
- Escalation handling: How to receive and manage AI-escalated patient interactions
- Protocol management: How to request protocol changes or flag issues
- Reporting: How to access and interpret engagement reports

Training is minimal by design — HANA operates autonomously. Staff interact with dashboards and escalation queues, not with the AI system directly.

| Role | Training Time | Focus |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Clinical lead | 60 minutes | Protocol review, quality oversight |
| Care coordinators | 45 minutes | Escalation handling, dashboard |
| Front desk staff | 30 minutes | Patient questions about AI calls |
| IT administrator | 45 minutes | Integration monitoring, troubleshooting |
| Executives | 20 minutes | ROI dashboard, summary metrics |

**Go-live approach:**
- Phased rollout: Start with 10-20% of eligible patients in the first week
- Ramp to 50% in week two, 100% by week three
- Dedicated HANA support team monitors every conversation during initial deployment
- Daily check-in calls during the first week, weekly thereafter

**Organization effort required:** 4-6 hours total across all staff

### Phase 5: Optimization (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Continuously improve performance, expand use cases, and maximize ROI.

**Monthly activities:**
- Performance review: Analysis of quality metrics, completion rates, and patient satisfaction
- Protocol refinement: Update conversation flows based on production learnings
- Use case expansion: Plan and deploy additional clinical protocols
- Integration deepening: Add data sources, automate additional workflows

**Quarterly activities:**
- ROI assessment: Measure actual financial impact against projections
- Strategic planning: Identify next-phase expansion opportunities
- Benchmark comparison: Compare performance against industry standards
- Clinical review: Medical advisory review of AI conversation quality

## Implementation Success Metrics

| Initial setup time | < 1 week | 3-5 business days |
| Staff training required | < 2 hours per role | 30-60 minutes |
| Time to first live conversation | < 30 days | 18-25 days |
| Integration test coverage | 100% | 98%+ |
| Data mapping accuracy | 99.9% | 99.95% |
| Staff adoption rate | > 90% | 95% |

## What We Handle vs. What You Handle

| HANA Handles | Organization Handles |
|-------------|---------------------|
| All infrastructure setup and management | EHR API credentials and access |
| Clinical protocol design and configuration | Clinical review and approval of protocols |
| EHR integration development | IT point of contact for integration |
| Voice and language configuration | Preferred voice and communication style |
| Quality monitoring and improvement | Escalation queue management |
| Compliance and security | BAA execution |
| Ongoing model updates | Feedback on conversation quality |
| 24/7 system monitoring | Staff training attendance |

## Common Implementation Questions

**Do we need to change our EHR configuration?**
No. HANA connects to your existing EHR APIs. We read patient data and write back conversation outcomes using standard interfaces.

**What if our EHR doesn't have a standard API?**
HANA supports HL7 FHIR, REST APIs, and can work with HL7v2 interfaces. For non-standard systems, we build custom connectors during the integration phase.

**How do patients know they're talking to AI?**
HANA introduces itself transparently at the start of every conversation. Patients are informed they're speaking with an AI assistant and offered the option to speak with a human instead.

**What happens when the AI can't handle a conversation?**
HANA performs a warm handoff to your staff with full conversation context. The staff member sees what was discussed, what information was collected, and why the escalation occurred.

**Can we customize the conversation scripts?**
Yes. Protocols are fully configurable — questions, branching logic, language, escalation triggers, and data collection requirements are all tailored to your organization's needs.

**What about patients who prefer not to interact with AI?**
Patient preferences are respected. Patients who opt out are flagged and routed to human staff. Opt-out rates are typically 2-3%.
