## Three Layers of Personalization

Healthcare is not one-size-fits-all. A behavioral health intake sounds nothing like a pre-surgical screening. A rural family practice operates differently from an urban multi-specialty group. Individual patients have communication preferences that affect engagement outcomes.

HANA personalizes conversations across three layers: organization, specialty, and individual patient.

## Organization-Level Settings

Each healthcare organization configures HANA to match its brand, policies, and operational standards.

**Brand Alignment:**
- Organization name and how it's referenced in conversations
- Approved greeting and closing language
- Tone guidelines (formal, warm, clinical, conversational)
- Branded terminology (e.g., "wellness visit" vs. "annual physical")

**Operational Configuration:**
- Business hours and after-hours behavior
- Call scheduling preferences (best times for outbound calls)
- Escalation routing (which staff receive escalated calls, by category)
- Maximum call attempts and retry intervals
- Voicemail handling and callback scheduling

**Compliance Rules:**
- Consent language requirements
- State-specific regulatory requirements
- PHI handling restrictions
- Recording and disclosure notifications
- Required disclaimers

**Reporting Preferences:**
- Dashboard metrics and KPIs
- Report frequency and distribution
- Alert thresholds and notification channels
- Data export formats and destinations

## Specialty-Specific Customization

HANA provides pre-configured protocol templates for clinical specialties, each customizable to the organization's specific practices.

### Available Specialty Templates

| Specialty | Protocol Types | Key Instruments |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Primary Care** | Annual wellness, chronic care check-in, medication review, care gap closure | PHQ-2, AUDIT-C, fall risk screen |
| **Behavioral Health** | Intake assessment, treatment follow-up, crisis screening, medication adherence | PHQ-9, GAD-7, CAGE-AID, Columbia Protocol |
| **Orthopedics** | Pre-surgical screening, post-op follow-up, physical therapy adherence | VAS pain scale, functional assessment |
| **Cardiology** | Heart failure check-in, medication titration, cardiac rehab adherence | KCCQ, symptom tracking |
| **OB/GYN** | Prenatal intake, postpartum screening, preventive care | Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale |
| **Pediatrics** | Well-child visit prep, vaccination follow-up, developmental screening | ASQ-3, M-CHAT |
| **Oncology** | Treatment adherence, symptom monitoring, palliative care check-in | ESAS, PRO-CTCAE |
| **Addiction Recovery** | Intake assessment, treatment matching, relapse check-in, follow-up | ASAM criteria, AUDIT, DAST-10 |

### Specialty Configuration Options

Each specialty template can be customized:

- **Clinical vocabulary**: Specialty-specific medical terminology and patient-facing explanations
- **Assessment instruments**: Which validated screening tools to administer and scoring thresholds
- **Billing integration**: CPT/HCPCS codes associated with each conversation type for automated billing
- **Referral patterns**: When and where to route patients based on screening results
- **Documentation requirements**: What structured data to capture for clinical notes

## Individual Patient Preferences

HANA builds and maintains a preference profile for each patient, improving the experience across interactions.

### Communication Preferences

**Language:**
- Primary language detection and preference storage
- Automatic language switching for multilingual patients
- Support for 30+ languages with clinical-grade accuracy
- Dialect and regional variation awareness

**Communication style:**
- Preferred level of detail (brief vs. thorough explanations)
- Pace preferences (faster for repeat patients, slower for complex topics)
- Formality level (clinical terminology vs. plain language)
- Preferred name and pronouns

**Contact preferences:**
- Best time to call (learned from answer patterns and explicit preferences)
- Preferred contact method (voice, SMS, or combination)
- Callback scheduling ("call me back tonight" remembered and executed)
- Opt-out preferences respected across all channels

### Per-Patient Memory

HANA remembers relevant information across conversations:

- **Care goals**: Goals set by the patient and their care team persist across interactions
- **Conversation history**: Prior discussion topics, unresolved items, and follow-up commitments
- **Behavioral patterns**: Typical response styles, areas of concern, topics that cause discomfort
- **Preferences learned**: Communication adjustments that improved engagement in prior calls

Memory is used to:
- Avoid re-asking information already captured
- Reference prior conversations naturally ("Last time we spoke, you mentioned your knee was improving — how is it now?")
- Adapt approach based on what worked before
- Track longitudinal patient engagement trends

### Preference Portability

Patient preferences follow the patient:
- Across different clinical protocols within the same organization
- Across departments and locations
- Through provider changes
- Across device and contact method changes

Preferences are stored securely and can be exported or deleted per patient request, in compliance with HIPAA and GDPR requirements.

├── Communication Preferences
│   ├── language: "es"
│   ├── preferred_name: "Maria"
│   ├── pace: "moderate"

```

### Privacy and Data Isolation

- Patient preference data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Strict tenant isolation ensures no data leakage between healthcare organizations
- Patients can request a copy of their preference profile or its deletion at any time
- Preference data is never used for model training without explicit de-identification and consent
- All preference access is audit-logged

## Personalization Impact

| Metric | Without Personalization | With Personalization | Improvement |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Call answer rate | 45% | 62% | +38% |
| Conversation completion | 71% | 84% | +18% |
| Patient satisfaction | 3.8/5 | 4.6/5 | +21% |
| Repeat engagement | 55% | 78% | +42% |
| Average call duration | 8.2 min | 6.5 min | -21% (more efficient) |
