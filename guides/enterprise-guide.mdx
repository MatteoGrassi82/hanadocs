## Enterprise Overview

HANA is built for enterprise healthcare organizations — multi-site health systems, large physician groups, behavioral health networks, and payer-provider organizations that need patient engagement at scale.

This guide covers enterprise-specific deployment considerations, including multi-tenant configuration, advanced EHR integration patterns, organizational rollout strategies, and enterprise security requirements.

## What HANA Does for Enterprise

HANA helps enterprise organizations:

- **Scale patient outreach** without scaling headcount — automate hundreds of thousands of patient conversations monthly
- **Standardize engagement quality** across sites, departments, and providers
- **Capture structured clinical data** from patient conversations directly into the EHR
- **Generate revenue** through BHI, CCM, and care gap closure billing
- **Reduce operational costs** by automating repetitive phone-based workflows

## Getting Started

**1. Establish Sponsorship**

Successful enterprise deployments require alignment across three stakeholders:
- **Clinical leadership**: Validates protocols, approves clinical workflows
- **IT/Integration**: Provides EHR API access, security review
- **Operations**: Defines priority use cases, measures ROI

**2. Choose Your Integration Path**

| Approach | Best For | Timeline |
|----------|---------|----------|
| API-first | Organizations with strong IT teams who want programmatic control | 2-3 weeks |
| Managed deployment | Organizations that want HANA to handle configuration end-to-end | 3-4 weeks |
| White-label embed | Platform partners who want HANA inside their own product | 4-6 weeks |

**3. Define Initial Scope**

Start narrow, prove value, then expand:
- Select 1-2 high-impact protocols (e.g., no-show follow-up, chronic care check-in)
- Deploy at 1-2 pilot sites
- Measure for 30-60 days
- Expand based on results

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Enterprise organizations with multiple sites, departments, or brands deploy HANA in a multi-tenant configuration:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tenant Isolation

- **Data isolation**: Patient data never crosses tenant boundaries
- **Configuration isolation**: Each tenant has independent protocols, voice settings, and escalation rules
- **Network isolation**: Tenant-specific encryption keys and access controls
- **Audit isolation**: Complete audit trail per tenant for compliance

### Shared Enterprise Services

- **Single sign-on**: Enterprise SSO (SAML/OIDC) across all tenants
- **Unified billing**: Single invoice with per-tenant breakdown
- **Rollup analytics**: Enterprise-wide dashboards with drill-down to tenant/site level
- **Centralized admin**: Enterprise administrators manage tenant creation, user provisioning, and policy enforcement

## Advanced EHR Integration

### Supported Integration Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Real-time FHIR** | Live read/write via FHIR R4 APIs | Patient data retrieval, appointment booking, clinical write-back |
| **Batch FHIR** | Scheduled bulk data exchange | Patient panel loading, care gap list generation |
| **ADT feeds** | HL7v2 ADT messages | Real-time admission/discharge/transfer notifications |
| **CCD/C-CDA** | Document exchange | Comprehensive patient summary import |
| **Custom API** | Organization-specific REST endpoints | Non-standard EHR or ancillary systems |

## Enterprise Security

### Authentication and Access

- **SSO integration**: SAML 2.0 and OIDC support for all major identity providers
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Required for all administrative access
- **Role-based access control**: Granular permissions by role (admin, clinical lead, coordinator, viewer)
- **Session management**: Configurable session timeout and concurrent session limits
- **IP allowlisting**: Optional restriction of admin access to approved networks

### Compliance

| Certification | Status | Scope |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| SOC 2 Type II | Active | Security, availability, confidentiality |
| HIPAA | Compliant | Full compliance with BAA |
| GDPR | Compliant | EU data protection |
| HITRUST | In progress | CSF certification |

### Enterprise BAA

HANA executes a Business Associate Agreement with every healthcare organization before processing any patient data. The BAA covers:

- All patient data processed through HANA's platform
- Conversation recordings and transcripts
- Structured clinical data extracted from conversations
- Integration data exchanged with EHR systems

## Enterprise Rollout Strategy

### Recommended Phased Approach

**Phase 1: Pilot (Month 1-2)**
- 1-2 protocols at 1-2 sites
- 500-2,000 patient conversations
- Focus: Prove clinical accuracy and patient acceptance
- Success gate: > 70% completion rate, > 4.0 patient satisfaction

**Phase 2: Expansion (Month 3-4)**
- Add 2-3 protocols, expand to 5-10 sites
- 5,000-20,000 patient conversations
- Focus: Validate operational integration and ROI
- Success gate: Measurable staff time savings, positive clinical feedback

**Phase 3: Scale (Month 5-8)**
