## Self-Hosted Architecture and Self-Correcting Models

### ROI Projections

**Quality Improvements:**
- Error reduction: Target 80% reduction in clinical data extraction errors through self-correction
- Patient satisfaction: Increase from baseline to > 4.5/5 CSAT through continuous quality improvement
- System reliability: 99.9% uptime with conversation quality guarantees
- Cost efficiency: Optimized model routing and caching reduce per-conversation inference costs

### Current Investment

**Infrastructure Costs:**
- Conversation and reasoning model hosting: integrated cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling
- Evaluation framework: LLM-as-judge integration and custom evaluation tooling
- Monitoring systems: extension of existing observability stack (Grafana, ELK, PagerDuty)
- Development resources: dedicated team for self-correction system development and protocol improvement

**Projected Savings:**
- Reduced human review: 70% reduction in manual conversation quality assurance
- Improved patient engagement: 25% increase in conversation completion rates reduces re-call costs
- Decreased support costs: 40% reduction in clinician-reported conversation issues
- Enhanced reliability: 50% reduction in conversations requiring human intervention

## LRMs as a Judge

### ROI Projections

**Quality Improvements:**
- Conversation quality increase: Target 40% improvement in average quality scores across protocols
- Error reduction: 60% decrease in quality-related clinical team escalations
- Consistency improvement: 90% reduction in quality score variance across conversations and protocols
- Protocol optimization: 50% faster identification and resolution of protocol design issues

**Cost Savings:**
- Reduced human review costs: significant annual savings in clinical quality assurance labor
- Decreased clinician support: 30% reduction in quality-related escalation volume
- Improved patient retention: higher engagement quality reduces patient opt-out rates
- Infrastructure efficiency: integration with existing compute resources minimizes additional hosting costs

## Healthcare Organization ROI

### Direct Cost Savings (Mid-Size Primary Care, 50 Physicians)

| Current State | Annual Cost |
|--------------|-------------|
| Care coordinators for patient outreach (4 FTEs) | $240,000 |
| Medical assistant phone time (~30% allocation) | $180,000 |
| Missed appointment revenue loss (8% no-show rate) | $450,000 |
| Incomplete intake rework and re-calls | $95,000 |
| **Total** | **$965,000** |

| With HANA | Annual Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| HANA platform fee | $180,000 |
| Reduced care coordinator need (4 → 2 FTEs) | $120,000 |
| Reduced MA phone time (30% → 10%) | $60,000 |
| Reduced no-show rate (8% → 3.5%) | $200,000 |
| Reduced intake rework | $25,000 |
| **Total** | **$585,000** |

**Net annual savings: $380,000 | ROI: 211% | Payback: 5.7 months**

### Revenue Uplift

| Revenue Driver | Mechanism | Estimated Annual Impact |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Reduced no-shows | Proactive outreach + rescheduling | $250,000 |
| BHI/CCM billing | Automated qualifying conversations for CMS codes | $180,000 |
| Care gap closure | Outreach for preventive screenings | $120,000 |
| Patient retention | Higher engagement reduces churn | $95,000 |
| **Total** | | **$645,000** |
