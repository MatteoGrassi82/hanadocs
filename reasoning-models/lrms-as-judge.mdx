## Overview

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) as a Judge represents HANA's advanced framework for autonomous quality assessment, conversation evaluation, and clinical accuracy validation. This system leverages capable evaluation models to assess outputs from the conversation engine, creating a hierarchical evaluation architecture that ensures quality, consistency, and reliability across all patient interactions.

Built on our service architecture, the LRM judging system provides reference-free evaluation, multi-dimensional scoring, and continuous quality assurance without requiring expensive golden datasets or extensive human annotation.

### Evaluation Metrics and KPIs

**Quality Assessment Metrics:**

Primary Quality Indicators:
- Overall quality score (1-5 star rating system)
- Dimension-specific scores (clinical accuracy, communication quality, protocol compliance, completeness)
- Confidence intervals for score reliability assessment
- Comparative rankings across model versions and protocol configurations

Performance Metrics:
- Evaluation throughput (conversations evaluated per minute)
- Response latency for real-time evaluation requests
- Judge model accuracy against human clinical reviewer ground truth
- Resource efficiency (cost per evaluation)

**Business Impact Measurements:**

Quality Improvement Tracking:
- Conversation quality trends over time and across clinical protocols
- Patient satisfaction correlation with judge model scores
- Error reduction rates attributable to judge-based quality control
- Cost savings from automated quality assurance vs. manual review

System Reliability Metrics:
- Judge model availability and uptime
- Evaluation consistency across different judge model instances
- False positive/negative rates for quality threshold decisions
- Escalation rates for human review requirements

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

Infrastructure Costs:
- Judge model hosting: integrated with existing inference infrastructure
- Evaluation framework: LLM-as-judge integration and custom evaluation tooling
- Monitoring systems: extension of existing observability infrastructure

Operational Efficiency Gains:
- Automated quality assurance: significant reduction in manual conversation review
- Consistent evaluation standards: elimination of subjective quality assessment variability
- 24/7 quality monitoring: continuous evaluation without human intervention
- Scalable assessment: linear scaling with conversation volume without proportional cost increase
