## HANA Direct

For clinics and health organizations deploying HANA as their engagement layer.

### Step 1: Provide Your Patient Roster

Send us your patient roster via secure file transfer or API. Minimum required fields:

```json
{
  "patients": [
    {
      "patient_id": "P-12345",
      "first_name": "Maria",
      "last_name": "Garcia",
      "phone": "+1-555-0123",
      "preferred_channel": "voice",
      "preferred_language": "en",
      "active_diagnoses": ["E11.9"],
      "medications": ["metformin 500mg"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Define Your Protocol

Upload your care protocol as a PDF, Google Doc, or structured JSON. HANA will configure agents to follow your protocol exactly.

**Example protocol definition:**
```json
{
  "protocol": {
    "name": "Diabetes Medication Adherence",
    "objective": "Monitor and improve medication adherence for Type 2 Diabetes patients",
    "frequency": "weekly",
    "channel_priority": ["voice", "sms"],
    "questions": [
      {
        "topic": "medication_adherence",
        "prompt": "How have you been doing with your medication this week?",
        "follow_up_if": "non_adherent",
        "follow_up": "What's been making it difficult?"
      },
      {
        "topic": "side_effects",
        "prompt": "Have you noticed any side effects?",
        "follow_up_if": "yes",
        "follow_up": "Can you describe what you're experiencing?"
      }
    ],
    "escalation_rules": {
      "critical": ["suicidality", "medical_emergency"],
      "high": ["medication_adverse_event", "significant_mood_decline"],
      "medium": ["non_adherence_3_consecutive", "mood_decline_trend"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or simply send us your existing protocol documents (PDF, DOCX, or clinical guidelines) and we'll configure it for you.

### Step 3: Connect Your EHR

Choose your integration path:

| Your EHR | Integration Path | Setup Time |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Athena Health | Via Redox | 2-4 weeks |
| PracticeQ | Direct API | 1-2 weeks |
| Charma | Direct API | 1-2 weeks |
| Other (with API) | Via Catagon or direct | 2-6 weeks |
| No EHR / Legacy | HANA Dashboard | 1 week |

### Step 4: Test

We'll provision a test environment where your clinical team can:
- Call your configured agents as if they were a patient
- Review generated clinical notes
- Validate escalation pathways
- Tune conversational style and tone

### Step 5: Go Live

Deploy to your pilot cohort (typically 50-100 patients). Monitor via the weekly KPI dashboard.

## HANA Connect (SDK)

For platforms embedding HANA's engagement capabilities into their product.

### Authentication

All API requests require a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.hana.health/v1/engagements \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hana_sk_live_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Note>
API keys are provisioned during partner onboarding. Contact us to get started.
</Note>

### Step 1: Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @hana-health/sdk
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @hana-health/sdk
```
```bash pip
pip install hana-health
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Initialize

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { HanaClient } from '@hana-health/sdk';

const hana = new HanaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.HANA_API_KEY,
  environment: 'production', // or 'sandbox'
  region: 'eu' // or 'us'
});
```
```python Python
from hana_health import HanaClient

hana = HanaClient(
    api_key=os.environ["HANA_API_KEY"],
    environment="production",
    region="eu"
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Create an Engagement

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const engagement = await hana.engagements.create({
  patient: {
    id: 'P-12345',
    phone: '+1-555-0123',
    preferredChannel: 'voice',
    language: 'en'
  },
  protocol: 'medication-adherence-diabetes',
  triggerType: 'scheduled',
  scheduledAt: '2026-02-08T10:00:00Z',
  callbackUrl: 'https://your-app.com/webhooks/hana'
});

console.log(engagement.id); // "eng_abc123"
console.log(engagement.status); // "scheduled"
```
```python Python
engagement = hana.engagements.create(
    patient={
        "id": "P-12345",
        "phone": "+1-555-0123",
        "preferred_channel": "voice",
        "language": "en"
    },
    protocol="medication-adherence-diabetes",
    trigger_type="scheduled",
    scheduled_at="2026-02-08T10:00:00Z",
    callback_url="https://your-app.com/webhooks/hana"
)

print(engagement.id)  # "eng_abc123"
print(engagement.status)  # "scheduled"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 4: Receive Results via Webhook

When the engagement completes, HANA posts results to your callback URL:

```json
{
  "event": "engagement.completed",
  "engagement_id": "eng_abc123",
  "patient_id": "P-12345",
  "status": "completed",
  "outcome": {
    "clinical_note": "Medication adherence: ~4/7 days. Barrier: cost (insurance change). Side effects: mild nausea, tolerable.",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "type": "review_medication_assistance",
        "priority": "medium",
        "assigned_to": "care_manager"
      }
    ],
    "risk_flags": [],
    "risk_level": "low",
    "metrics": {
      "engagement_score": 0.92,
      "completion_rate": 1.0,
      "interaction_count": 8
    }
  },
  "transcript_url": "https://api.hana.health/v1/engagements/eng_abc123/transcript"
}
```

### Step 5: White-Label (Optional)

Configure branding so patients experience your brand, not HANA's:

```javascript
const engagement = await hana.engagements.create({
  // ... patient and protocol config
  whiteLabel: {
    callerName: "Your Health Platform",
    callerId: "+1-555-YOUR-NUM",
    smsFrom: "YourHealth",
    voicePersonality: "warm-professional"
  }
});
```

## Sandbox Environment

All integrations start in sandbox mode:
- Test patients only (no real calls)
- Full API parity with production
- Simulated voice interactions for testing
- Webhook delivery to your test endpoints

```javascript
const hana = new HanaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.HANA_API_KEY,
  environment: 'sandbox' // No real calls, full API testing
});
```
