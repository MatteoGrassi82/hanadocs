## What is HANA Connect?

HANA Connect is our SDK-based integration model for platform partners. Think of it as **Stripe Connect for patient engagement** — your users see your brand, your interface, your experience. HANA powers the engagement intelligence underneath.

This is how digital health platforms, EHR vendors, and care management companies add voice and conversational AI to their product without building it themselves.

## When to Use HANA Connect

| Scenario | Use HANA Connect |
|----------|-----------------|
| You have a care platform and want to add voice engagement | ✅ |
| You're an EHR vendor wanting AI-powered patient outreach | ✅ |
| You're a digital health app with engagement drop-off | ✅ |
| You're building a new product and need engagement infrastructure | ✅ |
| You're a single clinic wanting HANA to engage your patients | Use HANA Direct instead |

### Real Example

A Series B digital health platform integrated HANA Connect in 6 weeks. Their patients experienced the platform's brand on every call and text. Result: 40% engagement lift in 90 days, with zero changes to the partner's existing UX.

## Branding Configuration

Control every patient-facing touchpoint:

```javascript
const engagement = await hana.engagements.create({
  patient: { id: 'P-12345', phone: '+15550123456' },
  protocol: 'post-discharge-day3',
  triggerType: 'scheduled',
  scheduledAt: '2026-02-08T10:00:00Z',
  
  whiteLabel: {
    // Voice calls
    callerName: "CareConnect Health",       // Caller ID display name
    callerId: "+18005551234",              // Your phone number
    voicePersonality: "warm-professional",  // Conversational style
    voiceId: "voice_sarah_en",             // Specific voice selection
    greeting: "Hi, this is Sarah from CareConnect Health calling about your recovery.",

    // SMS/WhatsApp
    smsFrom: "CareConnect",               // SMS sender name
    smsSignature: "— CareConnect Health Team",

    // Escalation
    escalationPhone: "+18005559999",       // Where patients are transferred
    escalationMessage: "I'm connecting you with a member of the CareConnect team now."
  }
});
```

### Voice Selection

Choose from available voices or request a custom voice profile:

| Voice | Language | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `voice_sarah_en` | English (US) | Warm, conversational, mid-range |
| `voice_james_en` | English (US) | Calm, professional, lower register |
| `voice_elena_it` | Italian | Warm, natural Italian |
| `voice_maria_es` | Spanish | Conversational Latin American Spanish |
| `voice_clara_en_uk` | English (UK) | Professional, reassuring |
| Custom | Any | Tuned to your specifications during onboarding |

<Note>
Some partners intentionally choose a voice that's clearly AI-identifiable. This is a clinical design choice — patients know they're speaking with an AI assistant, which can improve trust and reduce confusion.
</Note>

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

HANA Connect supports multi-tenant deployments natively. If you serve multiple clinics or organizations, each gets isolated configuration:

```javascript
// Create a sub-organization for each of your customers
const clinic = await hana.organizations.create({
  name: "Sunrise Family Practice",
  parentOrg: "your-platform-org-id",
  config: {
    protocols: ["medication-adherence", "post-visit-followup"],
    escalationPolicy: "sunrise-clinical-team",
    timezone: "America/Chicago",
    language: "en"
  },
  whiteLabel: {
    callerName: "Sunrise Family Practice",
    callerId: "+18005552222"
  }
});

// Create engagements scoped to the sub-org
const engagement = await hana.engagements.create({
  organizationId: clinic.id,
  patient: { ... },
  protocol: 'medication-adherence'
});
```

### Data Isolation

Each sub-organization has fully isolated:
- Patient records and engagement history
- Clinical protocols and configurations
- API keys and webhook endpoints
- Reporting and analytics

Your platform gets aggregate visibility across all sub-organizations for portfolio-level analytics.

## SDK Integration

### Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @hana-health/sdk
```
```bash pip
pip install hana-health
```
</CodeGroup>

### Initialize with Connect Mode

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
import { HanaClient } from '@hana-health/sdk';

const hana = new HanaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.HANA_API_KEY,
  environment: 'production',
  region: 'eu',
  mode: 'connect'  // Enables multi-tenant + white-label features
});
```
```python Python
from hana_health import HanaClient

hana = HanaClient(
    api_key=os.environ["HANA_API_KEY"],
    environment="production",
    region="eu",
    mode="connect"
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Core Operations

```javascript
// Register a patient
await hana.patients.upsert('P-12345', {
  firstName: 'Maria',
  lastName: 'Garcia',
  phone: '+15550123456',
  language: 'en',
  clinicalData: {
    diagnoses: [{ code: 'E11.9', description: 'Type 2 diabetes' }],
    medications: [{ name: 'Metformin', dose: '500mg' }]
  }
});

// Trigger an engagement
const eng = await hana.engagements.create({
  patient: { id: 'P-12345' },
  protocol: 'medication-adherence-diabetes',
  triggerType: 'immediate'
});

// Get results
const result = await hana.engagements.get(eng.id);
console.log(result.outcome.clinical_note);

// Get patient engagement history
const memory = await hana.patients.getMemory('P-12345');
console.log(memory.longitudinal_trends.medication_adherence);
```

## Typical Integration Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Kickoff call, API key provisioning, sandbox access |
| 2-3 | SDK integration, webhook configuration, branding setup |
| 4 | Internal testing with synthetic patients |
| 5 | Clinical team validation (protocol review, note quality) |
| 6 | Soft launch with pilot cohort |

**Total: ~6 weeks from kickoff to first patient interaction.**

## Partner Billing

HANA Connect partners are billed on a usage basis. Common models:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Per-engagement | Pay per completed patient interaction |
| PMPM | Per-patient-per-month flat rate |
| Revenue share | Percentage of incremental revenue generated |

Pricing is negotiated during partner onboarding and scales with volume.
