## Active Research

### Voice-Based Clinical Conversation Validation
- Ongoing study measuring clinical accuracy of AI-conducted patient conversations compared to human staff
- Evaluation across multiple clinical protocols: intake, chronic care management, behavioral health screening
- Metrics: information extraction accuracy, protocol compliance, patient satisfaction, clinical outcome correlation

### Consensus Mechanism Validation
- Systematic evaluation of multi-model consensus vs. single-model clinical reasoning
- Benchmarking against standard medical evaluation datasets
- Focus on calibration quality, hallucination reduction, and clinical safety margins

### Patient Engagement Outcomes
- Longitudinal study tracking patient engagement metrics (completion rates, re-engagement, satisfaction) across voice AI vs. traditional outreach methods
- Multi-site study across primary care, behavioral health, and specialty organizations
- Measuring downstream clinical outcomes: no-show reduction, care gap closure, medication adherence

### Voice AI Safety in Healthcare
- Research into safety boundaries for autonomous voice-based patient interactions
- Escalation threshold optimization: when should AI defer to humans?
- Adversarial testing for voice AI in clinical settings

## Publications

Research publications will be made available as studies are completed and peer-reviewed. Current work is in preparation for submission to healthcare informatics journals.

## Research Partnerships

HANA collaborates with healthcare organizations and academic institutions on clinical AI research. Contact research@hana.health for partnership inquiries.
