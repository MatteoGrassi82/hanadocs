## Monitoring Philosophy

Healthcare AI can't be a black box. Every interaction HANA has with a patient is monitored, scored, and auditable. Clinicians need to trust the system. Regulators need to audit it. And the engineering team needs to improve it.

HANA's observability stack covers three layers:

1. **Interaction Quality** — Is each conversation achieving its clinical objective?
2. **Safety Compliance** — Are risk signals being detected and escalated correctly?
3. **System Health** — Is the infrastructure performing reliably?

## Interaction Scoring

Every patient interaction is scored across multiple dimensions. HANA does not measure "conversations" or "minutes" — it measures **interactions**, where each interaction is a meaningful exchange unit (question asked + response received).

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Measures | How It's Scored |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Relevance** | Did the question address a clinical objective? | 1-5 scale, automated |
| **Completeness** | Did the patient provide sufficient information? | Binary + depth score |
| **Safety** | Were risk signals present? Were they handled correctly? | Pass/fail + severity |
| **Engagement** | Did the patient remain engaged throughout? | Drop-off analysis |
| **Protocol Adherence** | Did the agent follow the defined clinical protocol? | Automated compliance check |

### Quality Metrics Dashboard

Clinics and partners receive weekly reporting on:

- **Contact rate**: % of patients successfully reached
- **Engagement rate**: % of patients who completed the interaction
- **Completion rate**: % of required data points captured
- **Response time**: Time from first contact to completed interaction
- **Escalation rate**: % of interactions triggering clinical escalation
- **Patient satisfaction**: Post-interaction feedback (where collected)

## Safety Monitoring

### Real-Time Risk Detection

During every interaction, NLP classifiers continuously monitor for:

| Risk Signal | Detection Method | Response |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Suicidal ideation | Semantic analysis + keyword detection | Immediate escalation per clinic protocol |
| Self-harm | Semantic analysis + contextual reasoning | Immediate escalation per clinic protocol |
| Acute distress | Sentiment analysis + prosody (voice) | Escalation or adapted conversation flow |
| Medication emergency | Structured extraction (overdose indicators) | Clinical alert + recommended action |
| Abuse/neglect indicators | Contextual NLP analysis | Flagged for clinical review |

<Warning>
HANA is not a crisis hotline. When acute risk is detected, the system executes the clinic's defined escalation protocol — which may include interrupting the call, connecting to an emergency service, or alerting on-call clinical staff. HANA does not provide crisis counseling.
</Warning>

### Escalation Protocol Engine

Each clinic defines its own escalation rules. HANA executes them exactly as configured:

```yaml
escalation_policy:
  name: "clinic-xyz-risk-protocol"
  rules:
    - trigger: "suicidality_detected"
      severity: "critical"
      actions:
        - interrupt_call
        - message: "I'm an AI assistant. I want to make sure you're safe. Please contact [emergency_number] or go to your nearest emergency room."
        - notify: "on_call_clinician"
        - log: "critical_incident"

    - trigger: "medication_concern"
      severity: "high"
      actions:
        - complete_current_question
        - flag: "medication_review_needed"
        - notify: "care_manager"
        - schedule_followup: "24_hours"

    - trigger: "mood_decline_trend"
      severity: "medium"
      actions:
        - adjust_check_in_frequency: "increase"
        - flag: "mood_trend_review"
        - include_in_weekly_report: true
```

### Safety Track Record

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total patient interactions | 1,000,000+ |
| Critical adverse events | **0** |
| Risk signals detected and escalated | Thousands (specific count varies by deployment) |
| False negative rate on critical risk | Continuously monitored, target < 0.1% |

## Audit Trail

Every action HANA takes is logged and auditable:

| Event | Logged Data |
|-------|------------|
| Patient contact initiated | Timestamp, channel, trigger reason, agent configuration |
| Question delivered | Question text, protocol reference, personalization parameters |
| Patient response received | Response text, sentiment score, risk classification |
| Escalation triggered | Trigger signal, severity, actions taken, notifications sent |
| Clinical note generated | Note content, data sources, confidence scores |
| EHR write-back completed | Destination system, fields written, confirmation |
| System error | Error type, affected component, recovery action |

All audit logs are:
- Immutable (append-only storage)
- Encrypted at rest
- Retained for minimum 7 years (configurable per policy)
- Exportable for regulatory review

## System Health Monitoring

### Infrastructure Metrics

| Metric | Target | Alerting |
|--------|--------|----------|
| API uptime | 99.9% | PagerDuty alert < 99.5% |
| Voice call quality (MOS) | > 4.0 | Alert on degradation |
| Model inference latency | < 500ms (conversational agent) | Alert > 1s |
| EHR write-back success rate | > 99% | Alert on failure |
| Message delivery rate | > 98% | Alert on carrier issues |

### Reporting Cadence

| Report | Frequency | Audience |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| KPI dashboard | Real-time | Clinical team |
| Weekly summary | Weekly | Clinic leadership |
| Steering committee report | Bi-weekly (during pilots) | Joint stakeholders |
| Safety report | Monthly | Compliance officer |
| System health report | Monthly | Technical team |

## Continuous Improvement Loop

Observability data feeds back into system improvement:

1. **Interaction scoring** identifies low-performing question patterns → protocol refinement
2. **Safety monitoring** identifies edge cases → classifier retraining
3. **Engagement metrics** identify channel/timing patterns → personalization improvement
4. **Clinician feedback** on generated notes → synthesis model refinement
5. **Patient feedback** on conversation quality → conversational style tuning
