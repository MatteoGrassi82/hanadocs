## The Economics of Patient Engagement

Healthcare organizations spend between $150-250 per patient on manual engagement workflows — phone tag, missed appointments, incomplete intake forms, and staff time spent chasing information. Most of this cost is labor: medical assistants, care coordinators, and front desk staff performing repetitive, high-volume outreach.

HANA replaces the most expensive and least scalable part of this equation — the human-initiated phone call — with AI-driven conversations that cost a fraction per interaction while achieving higher completion rates.

## Cost Per Conversation

HANA's fully loaded cost per patient conversation:

| Component | Cost Per Conversation | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| LLM inference (reasoning engine) | $0.08 - $0.15 | Pre-call planning + post-call analysis |
| LLM inference (conversation engine) | $0.05 - $0.12 | Real-time dialogue, varies by length |
| Voice synthesis | $0.03 - $0.06 | Text-to-speech for outbound calls |
| Speech recognition | $0.04 - $0.08 | Real-time transcription |
| Telephony | $0.02 - $0.05 | SIP/PSTN per-minute costs |
| Infrastructure (compute, storage) | $0.02 - $0.04 | Amortized server costs |
| Evaluation & monitoring | $0.01 - $0.02 | Quality assurance pipeline |
| **Total per conversation** | **$0.25 - $0.52** | **Average: ~$0.35** |

Compare this to the cost of a human-performed equivalent:

| Method | Cost Per Contact | Completion Rate | Effective Cost Per Completed Engagement |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Medical assistant phone call | $12 - $18 | 35-45% | $30 - $50 |
| Care coordinator outreach | $15 - $25 | 40-55% | $30 - $60 |
| Text/SMS campaign | $0.50 - $1.50 | 15-25% | $3 - $8 |
| Patient portal message | $0.10 - $0.30 | 8-15% | $1 - $3 |
| **HANA voice conversation** | **$0.25 - $0.52** | **68-82%** | **$0.35 - $0.70** |

HANA achieves the engagement depth of a phone call at the cost of a text message.

## Infrastructure Architecture & Costs

### Current Production Infrastructure

HANA's infrastructure is designed for cost efficiency at scale through a cloud-native architecture:

**Compute:**
- Kubernetes-based orchestration on GCP/AWS
- Auto-scaling conversation engine pods (scale to zero when idle)
- GPU-accelerated inference for reasoning engine
- CPU-based inference for real-time conversation (optimized for latency over throughput)

**Storage:**
- Conversation transcripts and structured data in encrypted cloud storage
- EHR integration cache with configurable TTL
- Model artifacts stored in versioned object storage

**Networking:**
- SIP trunking for telephony with geographic redundancy
- WebSocket connections for real-time streaming
- VPN tunnels for EHR integration endpoints

### Monthly Infrastructure Costs at Scale

| Scale | Monthly Conversations | Infrastructure Cost | Cost Per Conversation |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Startup | 10,000 | $3,500 | $0.35 |
| Growth | 50,000 | $12,000 | $0.24 |
| Scale | 200,000 | $35,000 | $0.18 |
| Enterprise | 1,000,000+ | $120,000 | $0.12 |

Infrastructure cost per conversation decreases significantly at scale due to:
- Amortized fixed costs (base cluster, monitoring, security)
- Improved GPU utilization through batched inference
- Cached reasoning plans reused across similar patient profiles
- Negotiated volume pricing on telephony and cloud compute

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Intelligent model routing:**
- Simple conversations (appointment confirmation, basic intake) use smaller, faster models
- Complex conversations (behavioral health screening, medication reconciliation) use full reasoning pipeline
- Routing decisions made pre-call based on patient profile and protocol complexity

**Caching and reuse:**
- Reasoning engine outputs for common patient profiles are cached and reused
- Protocol-specific conversation plans are pre-computed and stored
- Voice synthesis segments for standard phrases are pre-generated

**Resource scheduling:**
- Outbound campaigns scheduled during off-peak compute hours
- GPU resources shared across inference workloads with priority queuing
- Auto-scaling ensures zero waste during low-volume periods

## ROI Model for Healthcare Organizations
