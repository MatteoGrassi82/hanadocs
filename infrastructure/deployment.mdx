## Deployment Models

Because HANA runs its own models on its own infrastructure (no dependency on OpenAI, Anthropic, or other third-party model providers), we can deploy wherever your data residency requirements demand.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Cloud (Managed)" icon="cloud">
    HANA-hosted infrastructure with region-specific data residency. The default for most deployments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="On-Premise" icon="server">
    HANA installed on your servers. Full data isolation. Currently piloting in Italy and the Middle East.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sovereign Cloud" icon="shield-halved">
    Deployed within government-approved sovereign cloud environments. Required for certain public sector contracts.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Cloud (Managed)

The standard deployment model. HANA manages all infrastructure, scaling, updates, and monitoring.

**How it works:**
- HANA runs on dedicated cloud infrastructure (not shared tenancy)
- Data is stored in region-locked environments (EU or US, configurable)
- No cross-border data transfer
- All models run on HANA-controlled compute
- Automatic updates and scaling handled by HANA engineering

**Best for:** Private clinics, behavioral health practices, digital health partners, FQHCs

**EHR integration:** Via Redox, Catagon, or direct API depending on EHR system

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Data residency | EU (Ireland) or US (configurable) |
| Encryption | AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit |
| SLA | 99.9% uptime |
| BAA | Available |
| Setup time | 2-4 weeks (standard EHRs) |

## On-Premise

For organizations that require all data and compute to remain within their own network boundary.

**How it works:**
- HANA's full model stack is installed on the organization's servers
- Licensed on an annual or per-deployment basis
- HANA provides installation support, initial configuration, and training
- Updates delivered as versioned packages (not automatic push)

**Currently piloting:**
- **Italy** — Large hospital system for HIV patient monitoring (mainframe-based infrastructure)
- **Middle East** — Sovereign cloud alignment with regional data sovereignty requirements

**Best for:** Large health systems, government healthcare, organizations with strict data sovereignty mandates, environments using legacy infrastructure (mainframes)

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Data residency | Your servers, your network |
| Model hosting | Installed locally, no external API calls |
| Encryption | Configurable to org policy |
| Updates | Versioned releases, manual deployment |
| Setup time | 4-8 weeks depending on environment |

<Warning>
On-premise deployments require dedicated engineering engagement for installation and configuration. Please contact the HANA team to scope your environment.
</Warning>

## Sovereign Cloud

For public sector and government contracts requiring deployment within certified sovereign cloud environments.

**How it works:**
- HANA is deployed within government-approved cloud infrastructure
- Compliant with national data sovereignty regulations
- Isolated from HANA's commercial cloud infrastructure
- Managed in partnership with the sovereign cloud provider

**Active government engagements:**
- **Ireland HSE** — Palliative care pilot covering 1.5 million lives
- **Italian regional health systems** — Budget allocated for multi-center deployment

**Best for:** Government health services, national health systems, military health, public sector mandates

## EHR Integration Across Deployments

Regardless of deployment model, HANA integrates with EHR systems through multiple pathways:

| Integration Path | Supported EHRs | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Redox** | Athena Health, Epic, Cerner, 150+ | Standard connector, platform fee applies |
| **Catagon** | Multiple (acts as Zapier for EHRs) | Flexible, good for multi-EHR environments |
| **Direct API** | Charma, PracticeQ, custom systems | Fastest setup, no middleware cost |
| **Custom dashboard** | Any (standalone) | For clinics without modern EHR or with legacy systems |
| **MCP Server** | Cloud-based workflows | Currently building MCP connectors for cloud integration |

<Note>
If your organization uses eClinicalWorks or another EHR that doesn't expose APIs, direct integration is not currently possible. We can provide a standalone dashboard as a workaround. This limitation applies to all vendors, not just HANA.
</Note>

## Environment Requirements

### Cloud (Managed)
No requirements on your side. HANA manages everything.

### On-Premise
- Linux-based server environment (Ubuntu 22.04+ or RHEL 8+)
- GPU compute: NVIDIA A100 or equivalent (for model inference)
- Minimum 64GB RAM, 500GB SSD storage
- Network: outbound HTTPS for telephony/SMS providers (or on-premise telephony gateway)
- Container runtime: Docker or Kubernetes

### Sovereign Cloud
- Approved cloud provider (e.g., AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, OVHcloud, Scaleway)
- Configuration scoped per contract

## Deployment Timeline

| Model | Typical Timeline | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Cloud + standard EHR (Athena, PracticeQ) | 2-4 weeks | Fastest path |
| Cloud + Redox connector | 4-6 weeks | Includes Redox onboarding |
| Cloud + custom EHR | 4-8 weeks | Requires API scoping |
| On-premise | 6-12 weeks | Includes installation + testing |
| Sovereign cloud | 8-16 weeks | Includes compliance validation |
