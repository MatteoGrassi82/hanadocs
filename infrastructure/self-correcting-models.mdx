## Why Self-Correction Matters in Voice AI

Text-based clinical tools have a safety net: a clinician reviews the output before it reaches the patient. Voice-based AI has no such buffer. When HANA speaks to a patient, there is no "edit" button. The system must detect and correct errors in real-time, during the conversation itself.

HANA's self-correction framework operates across three time horizons — immediate validation during each utterance, mid-conversation correction across the dialogue, and post-conversation analysis that feeds back into system improvement.

## Immediate Validation (< 200ms)

Every utterance passes through validation before reaching the patient. This adds minimal latency because the checks are lightweight and run in parallel.

### Template Compliance

The conversation engine selects responses from pre-approved templates generated by the reasoning engine. Immediate validation confirms:

- The selected template is appropriate for the current conversation state
- All variable slots (patient name, medication, date) are filled with verified data
- The template hasn't been corrupted by model generation artifacts
- Language register matches the patient's profile (formal, conversational, simplified)

### Entity Grounding Check

Every named entity in the utterance is verified against its source:

```python
# Simplified entity verification logic
def verify_utterance(utterance, patient_context):
    entities = extract_entities(utterance)
    for entity in entities:
        if entity.type == "medication":
            assert entity.value in patient_context.medications
        elif entity.type == "condition":
            assert entity.value in patient_context.conditions
        elif entity.type == "appointment":
            assert entity.value in patient_context.upcoming_appointments
        elif entity.type == "provider":
            assert entity.value in patient_context.care_team
    return True  # All entities grounded
```

If any entity fails grounding, the utterance is blocked and replaced with a safe fallback.

### Safety Filter

Real-time content safety checks catch:

- Clinically inappropriate advice (e.g., dosage suggestions outside protocol scope)
- Scope violations (e.g., attempting to diagnose when the protocol is intake-only)
- Emotional safety (e.g., dismissive language when patient expresses distress)
- Privacy violations (e.g., referencing information the patient hasn't consented to discuss)

## Mid-Conversation Correction

As the conversation progresses, HANA monitors the overall dialogue trajectory and corrects course when drift is detected.

### Context Coherence Monitoring

The system tracks whether the conversation remains coherent across turns:

- **Topic tracking**: Ensures each question relates to the current clinical objective
- **Reference resolution**: Confirms pronouns and references correctly map to prior mentions
- **Temporal consistency**: Catches contradictions (e.g., reporting a medication start date that conflicts with prior answers)
- **Logical flow**: Validates that follow-up questions make sense given previous answers

### Goal Completion Tracking

Each conversation has a defined set of information objectives from the reasoning engine. Mid-conversation monitoring tracks:

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| All goals on track | Continue normal flow |
| Goal at risk (patient avoiding topic) | Rephrase and re-approach from different angle |
| Goal blocked (patient refuses) | Log refusal, skip gracefully, flag for human follow-up |
| Unexpected information received | Capture and route to appropriate protocol branch |
| Conversation exceeding time target | Prioritize remaining high-value questions |

### Sentiment and Distress Detection

HANA monitors patient emotional state throughout the conversation:

- **Frustration detection**: Identifies rising frustration through speech patterns, response length, and explicit signals
- **Distress recognition**: Detects signs of emotional distress, anxiety, or confusion
- **Engagement tracking**: Notices disengagement (short answers, long pauses, off-topic responses)

When negative sentiment is detected, the system:
1. Acknowledges the patient's state with empathetic language
2. Adjusts pacing (slower, shorter questions)
3. Offers to pause or reschedule
4. If distress indicates safety risk, initiates warm handoff to clinical staff

### Real-Time Correction Strategies

When mid-conversation issues are detected, HANA applies graduated correction:

**Level 1 — Soft redirect**: Naturally steer the conversation back on track without calling attention to the correction.

*Example: Patient goes off-topic discussing general life stress during a medication review*
> "I hear you — that sounds like a lot to manage. Let me make sure we get your medication information right so your care team has everything they need. You mentioned you're taking lisinopril — are you still on the same dose?"

**Level 2 — Explicit clarification**: Directly address ambiguity or inconsistency.

*Example: Patient provides conflicting information about medication timing*
> "I want to make sure I have this right. Earlier you mentioned taking your medication in the morning, but just now it sounded like you take it at night. Which is it currently?"

**Level 3 — Graceful deferral**: When the system cannot resolve an issue, it defers to human judgment.

*Example: Patient describes symptoms outside the protocol's clinical scope*
> "That's important information and I want to make sure the right person follows up with you on that. I'll flag this for your care team. For now, let's continue with your medication review."

## Post-Conversation Analysis

After every conversation, HANA performs comprehensive quality analysis.

### Error Taxonomy

Every detected error is classified for systematic improvement:

| Category | Examples | Severity |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Entity error** | Wrong medication name, incorrect date | Critical |
| **Protocol deviation** | Skipped required question, wrong branch taken | High |
| **Comprehension failure** | Misunderstood patient response, incorrect extraction | High |
| **Tone/empathy gap** | Robotic response to distress, inappropriate humor | Medium |
| **Efficiency issue** | Unnecessary repetition, overly long conversation | Low |
| **Edge case** | Unhandled patient scenario, unexpected response format | Variable |

### Continuous Learning Loop

Post-conversation analysis feeds directly into system improvement:

1. **Protocol refinement**: Error patterns trigger protocol updates — new edge cases get explicit handling rules
2. **Template expansion**: Recurring phrasing failures lead to new response templates
3. **Model fine-tuning**: Aggregated error data informs the next model training cycle
4. **Calibration update**: Post-call accuracy data updates confidence calibration curves
5. **Safety test suite**: Every production error becomes a regression test case

## Quality Metrics

HANA tracks self-correction effectiveness through production metrics:

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Pre-delivery block rate** | Utterances blocked by immediate validation | < 3% |
| **Mid-call correction rate** | Conversations requiring course correction | < 8% |
| **Successful recovery rate** | Corrections that returned conversation to productive state | > 95% |
| **Post-call error rate** | Conversations with errors detected in post-analysis | < 1% |
| **Mean time to correction** | Average time from error detection to corrective action | < 500ms |
| **Patient-noticed error rate** | Errors that patients identified or complained about | < 0.1% |
| **False positive rate** | Correct utterances unnecessarily blocked or modified | < 1% |

## Operational Dashboards

Clinical operations teams access real-time and historical self-correction data:

**Real-time monitoring:**
- Live error detection rates across active conversations
- Correction queue status and processing latency
- Quality score distributions for current conversations
- System health indicators for correction services

**Historical analysis:**
