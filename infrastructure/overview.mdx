## What HANA Is (And Isn't)

HANA is **engagement infrastructure** for healthcare. Think of it as the equivalent of Stripe for payments or Twilio for communications — but purpose-built for continuous patient engagement between clinical encounters.

## Architecture at a Glance

HANA uses a **dual-model architecture** that separates clinical reasoning from real-time conversation. This is not a multi-agent swarm — it's a single reasoning engine that ingests data from five input layers to generate contextually appropriate patient interactions.

## Two Deployment Models

HANA ships two ways — directly into clinics, or as infrastructure that other platforms build on.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="HANA Direct" icon="plug" href="/developers/quickstart">
    **Like Stripe Checkout.** Plug HANA directly into your clinic. We handle configuration, EHR integration, and agent deployment. You get a working engagement layer in weeks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="HANA Connect (SDK)" icon="code" href="/developers/sdk">
    **Like Stripe Connect.** Build your own patient engagement experience on top of HANA's infrastructure. White-label our reasoning engine, voice, and SMS capabilities into your product.

## Key Technical Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Model Architecture** | Dual-model (Reasoning Engine + Conversational Agent) |
| **Model Hosting** | Self-hosted on HANA infrastructure (no OpenAI dependency) |
| **Foundation Models** | LLaMA 3.1 (voice), OSS reasoning models (fine-tuned) |
| **Data Residency** | EU (primary), US, configurable per deployment |
| **Channels** | Voice (phone), SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage |
| **EHR Integration** | Bidirectional via Redox, Catagon, direct API (Athena, Charma, PracticeQ) |
| **Compliance** | HIPAA, GDPR, BAA available |
| **Training Data** | 1M+ healthcare-specific patient interactions |
| **Latency** | Sub-second for conversational agent (pre-computed reasoning) |
| **On-Premise** | Available for enterprise and sovereign deployments |

## Design Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Separation of Reasoning and Conversation">
    The reasoning engine runs **before** the patient interaction, not during it. This means:
    - Zero latency penalty for complex clinical reasoning
    - The conversational agent has a bounded, pre-computed question set
    - No risk of hallucination during live patient calls
    - Off-topic drift is structurally impossible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Protocol-First, Not Prompt-First">
    HANA doesn't improvise clinical conversations. Every interaction is grounded in:
    - Clinic-defined care protocols (uploaded as PDFs, docs, or structured data)
    - Standardized clinical instruments (PHQ-9, DIVA, GAD-7, etc.)
    - Institution-specific escalation policies
    - Regulatory requirements per jurisdiction
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low User Burden">
    The system never asks for information it already has. The Data Science Agent analyzes EHR data before engagement, ensuring:
    - No redundant questions
    - Conversations start from existing context
    - Patient time is respected
    - Data quality improves (patients engage more when they feel understood)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Infrastructure, Not Application">
    HANA is designed to be invisible. Patients don't know they're using "HANA" — they're getting a call from their clinic. Partners don't rebuild their product — they add HANA's capabilities via SDK. This is plumbing, not a product on top.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Operational Track Record

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Patient interactions processed | **1,000,000+** |
| Weekly engagement rate | **85%** (vs. 15-20% industry) |
| Form completion rate | **96.2%** |
| Critical adverse events | **0** |
| Countries deployed | **5** |
| Languages supported | **3+** |
| Pilot-to-contract conversion | **67%** |
